# Glyphic

> ⚠️ **Early Development Notice**: Glyphic is in its very early stages. Expect frequent changes and improvements.

Glyphic is an open-source platform for creating, managing, and executing AI workflows locally and securely. Think of it as an open alternative to platforms like Gumloop, but with a focus on privacy, security, and local execution.

## 🚀 Vision

Glyphic aims to democratize AI workflow automation while keeping your data and processes under your control. No cloud dependencies, no data sharing - just powerful AI workflows running on your local machine.

## ✨ Key Features (Planned)

- 🏠 **Fully Local Execution**: All workflows run on your machine
- 🔒 **Privacy-First**: Your data never leaves your system
- 🔧 **Visual Workflow Builder**: Intuitive interface for creating AI pipelines
- 🔌 **Extensible**: Easy integration with popular AI models and tools
- 📦 **Standalone Executable**: Simple installation, no complex dependencies
- 🔄 **Universal Composability**: Export workflows to various AI frameworks

## 🎯 Composable Workflows

Glyphic is designed to be universally composable, allowing you to create workflows that can be exported and used with various AI frameworks:

### CrewAI Integration
- Export workflows as CrewAI agents and processes
- Define agent roles, goals, and interactions visually
- Seamlessly integrate with existing CrewAI projects

### Swarm AI Compatibility
- Convert workflows into Swarm AI patterns
- Define swarm behaviors and collective intelligence models
- Scale from single agents to complex swarm systems

### Additional Framework Support
- AutoGen: Create multi-agent conversations and workflows
- LangChain: Export as LangChain sequences
- MetaGPT: Transform workflows into MetaGPT compatible formats
- Custom Frameworks: Extensible export system for future AI frameworks

## 🗺️ Roadmap
